# Enhancements
- separate api for recurrence events
- recurrence events deletion (3 delete options : this event only, this and future events, all events)
- recurrence events end options : end on date, end on count, end on never
- backend does not allows reminders after event start, but this causes issues in all day events, so it should be fixed




# Additions
- migrate from Flask to FastAPI
- get users phone number while registering and verify it by otp on whatsapp
- getting reminders on whatsapp
- more personalised settings



# Some frontend ideas
- calendar view scrollable from one month to another
